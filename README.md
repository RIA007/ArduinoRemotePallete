# ArduinoRemotePallete

This lib is desinged for remote measurements for the "Measurement Automations" classes in SPbPU.

Using functions from the lib students can write LabVIEW programs to control DUTs on the remote host via Arduino Mega board.

# Working hours

Remote host is available

Tuesday 10.30-17.30

Saturday 10.00-17.30

Each student need to take login/password from the lab instructor.

After 15.12.2020 students need to make a request via https://t.me/RemoteLabs to access the server.

# Installation

On the computer that will receive the palette:
1. Place the folder containing the custom VIs in <LabVIEW>\vi.lib.
2. Place the .mnu file in the <LabVIEW>\menus\Categories directory.
  
As an example, if you place the .mnu file in <LabVIEW>\menus\Categories\Programming, your palette will show up in the Programming palette.
