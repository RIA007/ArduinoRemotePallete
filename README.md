# ArduinoRemotePallete

This lib is desinged for remote measurements during course "Measurement Automations" in SPbPU.

Using functions from the lib students can write LabVIEW programs to control DUTs on the remote host via Arduino Mega board.

# Working hours

Remote host is available

Tuesday 10.30-17.30

Saturday 10.00-17.30

Each student need to take login/password from the lab instructor.

# Installation

On the computer that will receive the palette:
1. Place the folder containing the custom VIs in <LabVIEW>\vi.lib.
2. Place the .mnu file in the <LabVIEW>\menus\Categories directory.
  
As an example, if you place the .mnu file in <LabVIEW>\menus\Categories\Programming, your palette will show up in the Programming palette.
