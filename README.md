# ArduinoRemotePallete

This lib is desinged for remote measurements in the "Measurement Automations" classes in SPbPU.

Using functions from the lib students can write LabVIEW programs to control DUTs on the remote host via Arduino Mega board.

Each student need to take login/password from the lab instructor.

2. Place the .mnu file in the C:\Program Files (or Program Files (x86))\National Instruments\LabVIEW 20ХХ\menus\Categories directory.

note: XX - installed LabVIEW version
  
As an example, if you place the .mnu file in <LabVIEW>\menus\Categories\Programming, your palette will show up in the Programming palette.
