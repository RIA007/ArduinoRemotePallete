# ArduinoRemotePallete

This lib is desinged for "Measurement Automations" and "Computer technologies in scientific research" classes in SPbPU.

Using functions from the lib students can write LabVIEW programs to control DUTs on the remote host via Arduino Mega board.

Each student need to take login/password from the lab instructor.

# Working hours

Remote host is available
