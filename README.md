# ArduinoRemotePallete
On the computer that will receive the palette:
1. Place the folder containing the custom VIs in <LabVIEW>\vi.lib.
2. Place the .mnu file in the <LabVIEW>\menus\Categories directory.
  
As an example, if you place the .mnu file in <LabVIEW>\menus\Categories\Programming, your palette will show up in the Programming palette.
